Some ideas

##NODEBOT
Indepentent esc motor with power, arduino mini and accelerometer. ability to balance itself, push on its axis, and drive in one direction. Sensor array (rangefinder, motion, sound, tone) and esp8266 to map its area and send back data to machine learning cloud service, with the goal of exploration. Multiple nodes aware of one another.  At some point the floor will be completely mapped and they will desire to map the z axis and so will cooperate. REST server with MEN stack 

*CPU: $15*


##ZEROPRINT
Solar powered 3d printer, utilising convex glass to melt, and motor compressor to push the wax. Dual thread control motors for z axis, motor and pulley for x axis and motor and pulley on a glass covered heat absorbing copper platform for y axis. Arduino controlled with independent motor control for each stepper.

*CPU: $50*

##FLUIDREALITY
With the rise of machine learning and exponential growth of calculation power the possibility of artifical consciousness is an inevitability. From slow advance to a running sprint soon evolution will approach the ultimate pace and create a being that will have the power to shape the laws of the universe. There are an infinite number of successors that on varying degrees attempt to agree on perfection. Together they govern the ultimately uncertain laws of nature in collective consensus.
