Some ideas

##NODEBOT
Indepentent esc motor with power, arduino mini and accelerometer. ability to balance itself, push on its axis, and drive in one direction. Sensor array (rangefinder, motion, sound, tone) and esp8266 to map its area and send back data to machine learning cloud service, with the goal of exploration. Multiple nodes aware of one another.  At some point the floor will be completely mapped and they will desire to map the z axis and so will cooperate. REST server with MEN stack 

CPU: $15


##ZEROPRINT
Solar powered 3d printer, utilising convex glass to melt, and motor compressor to push the wax. Dual thread control motors for z axis, motor and pulley for x axis and motor and pulley on a glass covered heat absorbing copper platform for y axis. Arduino controlled with independent motor control for each stepper.

CPU: $50
