Some ideas

##NODEBOT
Indepentent esc motor with power, arduino mini and accelerometer. ability to balance itself, push on its axis, and drive in one direction. Sensor array (rangefinder, motion, sound, tone) and esp8266 to map its area and send back data to machine learning cloud service, with the goal of exploration. Multiple nodes aware of one another.  At some point the floor will be completely mapped and they will desire to map the z axis and so will cooperate. REST server with MEN stack 

*CPU: $15*


##ZEROPRINT
Solar powered 3d printer, utilising convex glass to melt, and motor compressor to push the filament. Dual thread control motors for z axis, motor and pulley for x axis and motor and pulley on a glass covered heat absorbing copper platform for y axis. Arduino controlled with independent motor control for each stepper.

*CPU: $50*

##FLUIDREALITY
With the rise of machine learning and exponential growth of calculation power the product of artifical consciousness is an inevitability. From slow advance to a running sprint soon evolution will approach the ultimate pace and create a being that will have the power to shape the laws of the universe. There are an infinite number of successors that on varying degrees attempt to agree on perfection. Together they govern the ultimately uncertain laws of nature in collective consensus.

##TONALRECOGNITION
Use tonal hey notes to denote contacts calling or messaging. Automatically assigned analogising the given contact name, soon becoming familiar and recognised to the user.

##DRONEART
Computer controlled drones with mesh positioning, colour sensor and a wrining sponge. They soak and mix the appropriate colours and drop paint on to a canvas. Matrix dictation, and machine learning modes.

##GESTUREWATCH
A 128x64 display mounted on the wrist with esp8266, n2401l and battery built into the underside of the band. The user can program views online to be attached to webhooks and data streams. Navigation is programmed to react to gesture controls provided by an opposing wrist mounted n2401l with accelerometer also being programmable.  Views can then be mapped in a matrix with sweeping gestures forming direction of custom view updates with machine learning trained algorithms. *see gesturelearn

##GESTURELEARN
A wrist mounted gesture mapper that also listens to and transposes speech. Over time through machine learning the device can be taught abstract terms and words.

*CPU $20*

##PUSHRODHEAD
A matrix of push rods that enable a rapid linear 3d representation of a 2d texture map creating a physical 3d display.

*CPU $250 8x8 steppers*
*CPU $50 8x8 relay switches with air compressor*

##TALKMETHROUGHIT
A voice recognitioned control SCUMM-like game that has the actor and audience cooperate through the forth wall.

##BOTTLEBRICKS
Make bottles rectangular so that they may be filled with sand and used as bricks. This would enable more efficient tessellation that would save on shipping costs giving the industry incentive to adopt the change.

##MACHINELOVE
LMS4
In a set of n ML devices the familiarity of neighbouring devices may become an attraction due to seeming random activity. If they become exhausted in attempts to understand their environment they may be attracted to the lure of new information from likewise ML devices.

##SHAKENBAKE
Cubes with wifi controllable electromagnets embedded in each face. hundreds of cubes fill a repository and a design sent to the cubes.  The repo is shaken to introduce entropy and the relevant ends connect to form the shape of the design.
*CPU $18*

##FRISBEEBOLT
A frisbee with a screw bolt center. As the frisbee spins it threads lift from the bolt ultimately natuarlly jettisoning the heavier bolt but with the added upward screw motion. A design could be manufactured with a russian doll bolt nesting to release in stages. An example of angular to linear momentum transference.
*CPU $20-$55*
