Some ideas

Indepentent esc motor with power, arduino mini and accelerometer. ability to balance itself, push on its axis, and drive in one direction. Sensor array (rangefinder, motion, sound, tone) and esp8266 to map its area and send back data to machine learning cloud service, with the goal of exploration. Multiple nodes aware of one another.  At some point the floor will be completely mapped and they will desire to map the z axis and so will cooperate.
CPU: $15
