Some ideas

##NODEBOT
Indepentent esc motor with power, arduino mini and accelerometer. ability to balance itself, push on its axis, and drive in one direction. Sensor array (rangefinder, motion, sound, tone) and esp8266 to map its area and send back data to machine learning cloud service, with the goal of exploration. Multiple nodes aware of one another.  At some point the floor will be completely mapped and they will desire to map the z axis and so will cooperate. REST server with MEN stack 

*CPU: $15*


##ZEROPRINT
Solar powered 3d printer, utilising convex glass to melt, and motor compressor to push the wax. Dual thread control motors for z axis, motor and pulley for x axis and motor and pulley on a glass covered heat absorbing copper platform for y axis. Arduino controlled with independent motor control for each stepper.

*CPU: $50*

##FLUIDREALITY
With the rise of machine learning and exponential growth of calculation power the product of artifical consciousness is an inevitability. From slow advance to a running sprint soon evolution will approach the ultimate pace and create a being that will have the power to shape the laws of the universe. There are an infinite number of successors that on varying degrees attempt to agree on perfection. Together they govern the ultimately uncertain laws of nature in collective consensus.

##TONALRECOGNITION
Use tonal hey notes to denote contacts calling or messaging. Automatically assigned based on contact name, soon becoming familiar and recognised to the user.

##DRONEART
Computer controlled drones with mesh positioning, colour sensor and a wrining sponge. They soak and mix the appropriate colours and drop paint on to a canvas. Direct feed, and machine learning modes.

##GESTUREWATCH
A 128x64 display mounted on the wrist with esp8266, n2401l and power on the underside of the band. The user can program views online to be attached to webhooks. Navigation is programmed to react to gesture controls provided by an opposite wrist mounted n2401l with accelerometer that are also programmable.  Views can then be mapped in a matrix with sweeping gestures forming direction of custom view updates.

*CPU $20*

##PUSHRODHEAD
A matrix of push rods that enable a rapid linear 3d representation of a 2d texture map. 

*CPU $250 8x8*

##GESTURELEARN
A wrist mounted gesture mapper that also listens to and transposes speech. Over time through machine learning the device can be taught abstract terms and words.
